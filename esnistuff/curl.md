# Integrating curl

20190301

I'm starting to play with integrating this openssl build into curl.
I've not yet added any new stuff to curl, just building for now.

- curl can be built with openssl
- curl has some concept of using c-ares for DNS lookups, which we'll
  need to get ESNIKeys value(s)

I forked a version of curl for this from https://github.com/curl/curl

## curl Preliminaries

- clone curl:

            $ cd $HOME/code
            $ git clone https://github.com/sftcd/curl.git

- install c-ares (I did already for [wget](wget.md))

            $ sudo apt install libc-ares-dev

- get ready... and... build:

            $ cd $HOME/code/curl
            $ ./buildconf
            $  export LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/code/openssl"
            $ ./configure --with-ssl=$HOME/code/openssl --enable-ares
            $ make
            

    And that seems to work, I can at least run the resulting binary:

            $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/code/openssl
            $ src/curl https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/blob/master/esnistuff/curl.md
            ... expected output, being this file:-) ...

## Coding 

All new ESNI code will be protected via ``#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_ESNI`` as
done within the OpenSSL library. 

__TODO:__ check this for fit with coding conventions used in curl.

Just as a first step, I added a ``#include <esni.h>`` to ``lib/vtls/openssl.c``
and all seems well.

## Command line arguments, and behaviour

Most of this will be modelled on what we did for ``openssl s_client`` with
the difference that curl has the ``c-ares`` DNS libarary so can try
fetch ESNIKeys values internally.

Our model here is that if ESNI is available, we'll use it. However, given
that we may need to specify a specific cover hostname might be needed, 
and that ESNI will be initially rare, we'll add a command line argument
like ``--esni[=COVER]`` that can take an optional covername.
